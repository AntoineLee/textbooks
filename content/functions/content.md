Welcome to the Hogtagon School of Magic! It’s your first day, and before the big welcome feast, all new students need to be assigned to different houses by the Sorting Hat.

### Define Sets and Relations

While everyone is sleeping, let’s think some more about the three exercises we’ve done so far. In each example, there were two groups of things (like students, houses or wands), which we connected.

In mathematics, groups of things like this are called [__sets__](gloss:set), and connections between two sets are called [__relations__](gloss:relation). Relations can take many different forms, and you might have already noticed some similarities and differences between the examples we’ve seen above.
